			<b>ERP for Sugar and Allied Industry</b>
			<p>Multilingual SwappERP is being designed for Sugar Industry 
			where there is no such portfolio available in the current scenario.
			To be reluctant with something is good for some time but when 
			the things does not allow us to be part with that then we have 
			to be there to get an advantage of such scenario where there is 
			nothing such thing ever. We are now in a position to be pioneer 
			in the field of ERP for Sugar Industry where factories are in remote 
			places and human resources are not available. 
			Though it is the fact of the time but also so many have ever 
			tried much of the things, things are not moving in the direction 
			where it should be. It is our goodwill to be the part of such 
			association with the Sugar Industry for decades and more. 
			So only we are naturally supporting the industry for long time. 
			It is our perception that when  the technology is concerned we are 
			lagging behind is not possible but also it is the fact of the the matter 
			which nobody but we should take care of it. We are of view that when there is 
			somebody who is not concerned about these things we should not worry for today 
			but for tomorrow. We are not getting the situation in which so many 
			complications has to be there where nobody will help you out. 
			So to be the part of such mission in which you will also participate 
			will benefit you and Sugar Industry.Feel free to contact us.
